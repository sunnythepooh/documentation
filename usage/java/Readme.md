All Raspbian image contains a copy of Oracle Java 7 implementation and you can develop Java application from your Raspberry Pi. This tutorial will get you started developing and running Java application on our Raspberry Pi.

# How does Java work?

One of the main design principal of Java is "Write Once, Run Anywhere" - this means that compiled Java program will work on any platform that supports Java without any changes. In order to achieve this, Java Program is compiled into bytecode which can then be run on top of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can be implemented on different computer platform.
